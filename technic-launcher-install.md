## Technic Launcher Install

**Step 1:** Install Java 8 for your platform. If on windows, select "Windows Offline x64" on the download page. Link: [www.java.com/download/manual.jsp](https://www.java.com/download/manual.jsp)
(If you can't run the installer and you're on windows, add .exe to the end of the filename)

**Step 2:** Install the Technic Launcher for your platform. Link: [https://www.technicpack.net/download](https://www.technicpack.net/download)

**Step 3:** Move the TechnicLauncher.exe file to your desktop, as you will need it to launch modded minecraft.

**The launcher is now installed!**
